# Notification Popup Removal

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed NotificationPopupHandler Component
- Completely removed the `NotificationPopupHandler` component from the patient repair status page
- This was the main component responsible for automatically displaying popups when users visited the repair status page

### 2. Simplified EmailNotificationButton Component
- Converted the `EmailNotificationButton` to a simple button that links to a "mailto:" URL
- Removed all popup-opening code and API calls
- The button now directly opens the user's email client with a pre-filled subject and body about their repair
- This provides a simpler, more reliable way for patients to request email updates

### 3. Updated Providers Component
- Removed the `EmailNotificationProvider` from the global providers
- Kept the necessary `AuthProvider` to maintain authentication functionality
- Simplified the provider structure to only include essential providers

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: Eliminated the automatic popups that were causing user frustration
2. **Simplified User Experience**: Users now have a clear, direct way to request email updates if they want them
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Removed complex state management and conditional logic for popup handling
4. **Better Performance**: Fewer API calls and components mean faster page loads

## Testing

The application has been tested to ensure:
- No popups appear automatically on any page
- The email button works correctly for users who want to request updates
- All other functionality remains intact

## Next Steps

If email notification functionality is still desired in the future, we recommend:
- Implementing it as an opt-in feature triggered by explicit user action
- Adding it as a setting in user preferences rather than a popup
- Ensuring it's only shown on relevant pages and doesn't interrupt the user experience
